\chapter{Background}\label{chap:background}
The basis of CurbNet is semantic segmentation using convolutional neural networks.
As such, it is imperative that the reader has an understanding of the principles behind semantic segmentation and convolutional neural networks.
This chapter on the background of this work will discuss semantic segmentation, machine learning with artificial neural networks and convolutional neural networks, curb segmentation, loss functions, and network optimizers.

\section{Semantic Segmentation}\label{section:background-segmentation}
Unlike image classification, which classifies the contents of an image, semantic segmentation is the use of some algorithm to process an image and assign class labels to each individual pixel~\cite{segmentation-medium}.
This adds the ability to locate and classify multiple objects in a given scene.
For example, the ground truth segmentation of the street-level image in \figref{fig:background-raw} can be seen in \figref{fig:background-segmented}.
Each pixel of the image has been assigned a class, which is represented by the different colors in the segmented image.
This allows a computer or program to understand what objects are in the image it is shown.

By segmenting an image in this way, the program can interpret the or its environment semantically.
For example, by receiving the segmented image, a program can identify that there are line markings on the road and that there is a vehicle in front of it.
The segmentation of images in this way is essential in many robotic applications as it allows further higher level processing of the scene.

Towards the goal of this work, the segmentation of curbs and curb cuts in a scene would allow Obelix to more accurately find a path allowing for the safe traversal from sidewalk to street level via curb cuts.

In recent years, state-of-the-art methods in image segmentation have relied entirely on deep learning using CNNs to achieve better results.

\section{Curbs and Curb Cuts}\label{section:background-curbs}
Curbs are the edges of roads, or the separator between the road and some other area, usually a pedestrian sidewalk, and are usually stone or concrete.
Curb cuts are "cuts" in the curb that allow a pedestrian sidewalk to have a gentle slope down to street level.
Originally, these cuts were made to allow accessibility access, especially for those requiring wheelchairs, as to a wheelchair user, curbs represent a significant barrier in terms of traversability, as was discussed in the article "Curb Cuts" by Cynthia Gorney and Delaney Hall. These curb cuts first started appearing fifty years ago from the efforts of activist Ed Roberts and his push to make city streets more accessible.

\section{Loss Functions}\label{section:background-loss}
The loss function $l$ maps the output of the neural network $\hat{y}$ and the target $y$ onto a real number and represents the "cost" of an output.
The goal of learning is to minimize this cost value, known as the network loss.
Effectively, the loss function measures the difference between the predicted value and the target.
In our case, the target value is the ground truth labeling of an image and the output is the predicted labeling from the network.
There are many different loss functions that are commonly used. For the purposes of image segmentation, the most commonly used function is cross entropy loss.

The weighted variant, known simply as weighted cross entropy loss, is the basis of the custom loss function we use for CurbNet and is defined as:
\begin{align}
	\text{loss}(x, class) &= weight[class]\left(-\log\left(\frac{\text{exp}(x[class])}{\sum_{j}\text{exp}(x[j])}\right)\right)
\end{align}
where $x$ is the predicted labeling, $class$ is the ground truth labeling, $weight$ is the weight given to each class, and $j$ is the individual pixels in $x$.

The use of cross entropy loss is to ensure that the cost increases exponentially as the predicted probability approaches zero.
This due to its use of a negative log function, whose value exponentially increases as it approaches zero.
Using the weighted version allows us to change how much each class contributes to the loss.
We do this to counteract the class imbalance caused by how small spatially the curbs are relative to the rest of the scene.

\section{Optimizers}\label{section:background-optimizers}
During training, network parameters must be updated to minimize the loss function at each iteration.
This is done by the optimizer.
The optimizer updates the network parameters in such a way as to minimize the loss function~\cite{optimizer-intro}.

Gradient Descent is one of the oldest loss functions used.
It works by calculating what a small change in each network parameter would do to the loss function, i.e. determines the optimal gradient for the current iteration.
It then adjusts the network parameters according to this gradient.
This process is repeated at each iteration to further minimize the loss function.
This process can be time consuming, especially with larger datasets.
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a more commonly used variant of gradient descent and works similarly, but working only on randomly selected batches of the training data at each iteration~\cite{optimizer-intro}.

Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) is another loss function that is commonly used and the one implemented in CurbNet.
It combines concepts from Adaptive Gradient Algorithm (AdaGrad), which has per-parameter learning rates, and Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp), whose learning rates are adapted based on the average of the magnitude of recent gradients~\cite{adam}.
Adam utilizes the concept of momentum, which incorporates previous gradients into the current one.
It does this by calculating an exponential moving average and the square of previous gradients and using these to determine the next gradient.
The original paper that proposed Adam, titled "Adam: A method for stochastic optimization" by Diederik Kingma and Jimmy Ba, also shows that Adam allows a network to converge faster than competing optimizers, including SGD~\cite{adam}.

\section{backpropagation}\label{section:background-backpropagation}
backpropagation is a learning procedure used in artificial neural networks to adjust network weights and produce internal representations "important features in the task domain", first described the David E. Rumelhart, Geoffrey E. Hinton, and Ronald J. Williams in their paper "Learning representations by back-propagating errors"~\cite{backprop}.
backpropagation efficiently and repeatedly adjusts the network weights to minimize the network error, which is calculated by the loss function.

Calculating the network weights is done layer by layer, starting with the final output layer.
The effect the output unit has on the loss is calculated first as
\begin{align}\label{eq:loss-1}
	\frac{\partial \text{loss}}{\partial y_j}
\end{align}

where $y_j$ is the output of a single unit in the final layer.
The contribution of the input of the unit $j$ on the error can then be calculated using the value previously calculated in \eqref{eq:loss-1}
\begin{align}\label{eq:loss-2}
	\frac{\partial \text{loss}}{\partial x_j} &= \frac{\partial \text{loss}}{\partial y_j} \cdot \frac{\partial y_j}{\partial x_j}
\end{align}
We now have a description of how changing the input of unit $j$ will affect the loss.
As such, we can then also represent how changing the weight $w_{ji}$ of a connection between the unit $j$ and a unit in the previous layer $i$ will effect the error as
\begin{align}\label{eq:loss-3}
	\frac{\partial \text{loss}}{\partial w_{ji}} &= \frac{\partial \text{loss}}{\partial x_j} \cdot \frac{\partial x_j}{\partial w_{ji}}
\end{align}
In this case, the previous layer means the layer which during forwards-propagation would be calculated immediately before the layer in which unit $j$ is.
Again, due to the use of the chain rule, the previous value calculated in \eqref{eq:loss-2} can be used here.
This gives us the contribution of the weight $w_{ji}$ on the error and, by multiplying by the learning rate, the amount by which the gradient must be changed for the next training iteration.

The error contribution of the output of unit $i$ via a single successor unit $j$ can also similarly be calculated using the value from \eqref{eq:loss-2}.
\begin{align}\label{eq:loss-4}
	\frac{\partial \text{loss}}{\partial y_i} &= \frac{\partial \text{loss}}{\partial x_j} \cdot w_{ji}
\end{align}
Since unit $i$ is connected to multiple successor units, its value is a summation of its output contribution via all units $j \in J$, where $J$ is the set of all units in successive layers that $i$ is connected to.
\begin{align}
	\frac{\partial \text{loss}}{\partial y_i} &= \sum_{j \in J} \frac{\partial \text{loss}}{\partial x_j} \cdot w_{ji}
\end{align}
This calculation can be done in parallel, thanks to parallel computing architecture, completing to gradient calculations for the penultimate layer.
This procedure is then repeated for all layers, each time using the previously computed values to allow for efficient computation.

The main drawback of backpropagation is that it may approach local minima which are not the global minimum, at which point the network can potentially get stuck and become unable to improve.
The addition of more units, thus increasing the weight dimensionality, can increase the number of paths out of local minima.
Futhermore, the authors of the previously mentioned paper have also concluded that this is not a plausible model for how learning works in biological brains and, thus, that looking into other biologically based procedures may be useful.

\section{Binary Dilation}\label{section:background-dilation}
Binary dilation is a basic morphological operation and is usually represented by the operator $\oplus$.
With regards to this work, binary dilation is used in our loss function.
For a given binary image viewed as an integer grid $\mathbb{Z}^d$ for some dimension $d$, let $E$ be an integer grid, $A \in E$ a binary image, and $B \in \{0,1\}^d$ a structuring element.
The binary dilation of $A$ by $B$ is then defined as:
\begin{align}
	A \oplus B &= \bigcup_{b \in B}A_b
\end{align}
where $A_b$ is the translation of $A$ by $b$.
This can be seen as extending the area of the binary image $A$ by locus of the points covered by $B$ given that $B$ has a center on the origin~\cite{morphology}.
