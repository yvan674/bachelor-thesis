\chapter*{Abstract}
In this work we propose CurbNet, a deep learning model based on DeepLab v3+ \cite{deeplab} with a modified version of cross entropy loss, for the purpose of curb, curb cut, road, and sidewalk segmentation.
Using the encoder-decoder architecture from DeepLab v3+, CurbNet is capable of segmenting curbs and curb cuts in street-level imagery and can be used to aid the pathfinding pipeline used by the Obelix robot \cite{europa}.
In this work, we show that CurbNet is capable of performing this task, with its hyperparameters optimized using bayesian optimization and hyperband tuning \cite{bohb} and trained on the Mapillary dataset \cite{mapillary}.
