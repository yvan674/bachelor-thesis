\chapter{Introduction}\label{chap:introduction}
Semantic scene segmentation is a popular research topic in the field of computer vision, and especially important for autonomous vehicles.
The ability to semantically understand a scene is especially important for autonomous vehicles and robots to safely navigate an environment.
Generally, most implementations attempt to segment road surfaces but in this thesis, we propose the segmentation of curbs and curb cuts to allow safer sidewalk navigation.

The Europa project has resulted in the Obelix robotic platform, which has already been demoed to successfully perform pedestrian navigation \cite{europa}\cite{obelix-slam}.
We propose to add to this platform the ability to detect curbs and curb cuts using semantic segmentation.
The Obelix platform is the result of a joint project to build a robotic platform capable of robotic navigation~\cite{europa}. \todo{Add short description}.

Our goal is thus to implement a computer vision algorithm capable of the semantic segmentation of curbs and curb cuts using a single camera image.
To do so, we will implement a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a traditional encoder-decoder architecture.
We will also include prior knowledge to the training, since we can assume that the camera setup for the Obelix robot will remain relatively similar throughout its lifespan.

We will begin by discussing the motivation behind this thesis, followed by a disucssion of related works and the background.
Then the approach will be discussed in detail along with the experiments and results.
Finally, a discussion of potential future research will be presented followed by the conclusion.
