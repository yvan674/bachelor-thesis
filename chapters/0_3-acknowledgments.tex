I would also like to thank my advisor Jannik Zürn for the support and feedback he has given me during both the experimental and the writing phase of my thesis.
Thank you for helping me and being my guide in this journey through the sometimes opaque world of machine learning.

And finally, thank you to Prof. Dr. Wolfram Burgard for taking the time to look through my thesis and for any feedback you will provide.
