@inproceedings{successivehalving,
	Abstract = {Motivated by the task of hyperparameter optimization, we introduce the \em non-stochastic best-arm identification problem. We identify an attractive algorithm  for this setting that makes no assumptions on the convergence behavior of the arms' losses, has no free-parameters to adjust, provably outperforms the uniform allocation baseline in favorable conditions, and performs comparably (up to \log factors) otherwise. Next, by leveraging the iterative nature of many  learning algorithms, we cast hyperparameter optimization as an instance of non-stochastic best-arm identification. Our empirical results show that, by allocating more resources to promising hyperparameter settings, our approach achieves comparable test accuracies an order of magnitude faster than the uniform strategy. The robustness and simplicity of our approach makes it well-suited to ultimately replace the uniform strategy currently used in most machine learning software packages.},

@inproceedings{unet,
	Abstract = {There is large consent that successful training of deep networks requires many thousand annotated training samples. In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU. The full implementation (based on Caffe) and the trained networks are available at http://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net.},
